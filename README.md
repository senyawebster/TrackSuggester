## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download bootstrap_
* _Download jquery_

## Known Bugs

_{Only works for a specific few user-inputs. This was largely written based on several other attempts at the same from different corners of the internet like stackoverflow, etc, and my understanding of arrays is lacking. The bugs are mostly a result of this.  }_
